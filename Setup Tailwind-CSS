The browser automatically does not allow you to use Tailwind-CSS in making of your website, to make it happen you have to make it ready for production bt having 
these command on your VS-Code Terminal.

npm init -y       //This initializes the directory as a NodeJs project.
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer vite   //This will install postcss and other required packages.
npx tailwindcss init    //Creates a json file.


Now you will have following files created with the index file which you created earlier.
  ---package-lock.json
  ---package.json
  ---tailwind.config.js
  
after this you have to make some modifications in files:
in package.json file
  ---add "start":"vite" to your scripts
in tailwind.config.js
  ---Replace content:[] with content["*"],

Here the intallation and setup for production  has been completed. Now you have to restart the development server by running th following code:
  ---npm run start
   
Now you are ready to use your Tailwind-CSS for the production of your website.
